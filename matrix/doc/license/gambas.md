# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas
## Chapter 1 - Introducing Gambas

Gambas was initially created by Benoît Minisini, a resident of the suburbs
of Paris. According to Benoît, Gambas is a Basic language with object extensions.
The name itself is a play on the words "Gambas almost means Basic" and,
according to the author, Gambas evolved because of his personal programming
experiences with the Microsoft Visual Basic ® software product 1 . Rather than
contend with the horrendous number of bugs and idiosyncrasies found in that
product, he decided to create Gambas.
Gambas is licensed under the GNU Public License 2 and has taken on a life
of it's own due to its immense popularity. Gambas runs on most of the major
Linux platforms and the current (at the time of this writing) stable version is
Release 1.0.9. Minisini makes it very clear that Gambas is not compatible with
Visual Basic and it will never be made compatible. The syntax and internal
workings of Gambas are far better and more user friendly. Minisini stated [sic]
that he “took from Visual Basic what he found useful: the Basic language, the
development environment, and the ability to quickly [and easily] make programs
with [graphical] user interfaces.” 3
Minisini disliked the overall poor level of programming that is common
among many Visual Basic programs. Many believe that this problem may be due
to the “enforced” use of quirky programming practices imposed on developers as a
result of the wide range of bugs and the strange idiosyncrasies of the proprietary
VB language. Gambas has been developed to be as coherent, logical and reliable
as possible. Because it was developed with an approach designed to enhance
programming style and capture the best the Basic programming language has to
offer, the addition of object­based programming has allowed Gambas to become a
popular, modern, stable, usable programming environment for Linux developers.
Gambas Architecture
Every program written with Gambas Basic is comprised of a set of project
files. Each file within a project describes a class. The class files are initially
compiled and subsequently executed by the Gambas Interpreter. This is very
similar to how Java works. Gambas is made up of the following programs:
