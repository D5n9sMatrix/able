# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas

Once you have clicked on the “OK” button to finish this wizard, Gambas
will present you with the Gambas integrated development environment (IDE).
The IDE consists of several components that are shown in Figure 8 on the next
page. <br/>

## Gambas IDE Components

The Project Explorer is the main Gambas window. It show you a TreeView
of the types of files found within your project (i.e., class files, forms, modules, and
other types of files such as data and picture or icon files) and the Project Explorer
allows you to perform most Gambas project management operations, such as
opening and saving projects, building executables, running your program or
debugging it, showing or hiding various Gambas dialogs, etc. From the TreeView
in the Project Explorer, you will see the items listed as follows: <br/>

✔ Classes <br/>
✔ Forms <br/>
✔ Modules <br/>
✔ Data <br/>


Classes lists the class files you've created for your project. Classes are
basically templates that can be used to make objects out of at runtime, with code
to define properties, methods and event handlers for each object you create.<br/>
