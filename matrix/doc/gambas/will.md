# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas

Gambas. We will come back to this project to develop a program that uses the
GUI after we learn a bit more about the Gambas coding environment, the primary
language concepts that are required to use Gambas, and some basics about dataÂ­
types and variables. That is all covered in the next section and constitutes the
remainder of this introduction to Gambas programming. For now, take a short
break and we will continue when you come back.
