<h1>A Beginner's Guide to Gambas</h1>
<p>We will cover Gambas components in greater detail later in this book. By default,
the Gambas Interpreter is a text­only (console­based) program. The component
architecture is used for the graphical user interface (GUI) part of the language.
Because the GUI is implemented as a Gambas component, it has the ability to be
independent of any specific GUI toolkit. With Gambas, you can write a program
and choose which toolkit, such as GTK+ 6 , Qt 7 , etc., to use later. The current
release of Gambas implements the graphical user interface with the Qt toolkit.
The GUI components are derived directly from the QT library. It is recommended
that the reader also consult with the QT documentation 8 to better understand the
GUI controls. According to Minisini, a GTK+ component with a nearly identical
interface as the Qt component is planned.</p>
