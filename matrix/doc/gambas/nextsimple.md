# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas

Simply click the Next>> button and you will be presented with another
dialog that requires you to choose the type of project you want to create (see
Figure 4, below). This dialog requires you to pick between a GUI project or a
console project.

to create.

For our example, choose the first selection, “Create a graphical project” and
click the Next>> button at the bottom of the dialog. The next dialog that you
will see requires you to name your project and choose where it will be located on
your local file system. It is shown in Figure 5 below.
This section of the wizard has you to specify the name of the project as it
will be stored on disk. Remember, in Gambas a project is entirely self­contained
in a directory or folder. The folder name you choose as the name for the project
is what will be created on your system.
The title of the project will be what you specify in the second text input
field of the dialog. Additionally, the Options section allows you to choose
whether or not your project will be translatable and if the controls used on your
forms are going to be made publicly accessible. We will discuss these option in
more detail later in this book. For now, just fill out the dialog as shown in Figure
5 and click Next>> .
