<p>The View menu will allow you to bring up the properties window or the
ToolBox window. You can open a console or use the Icon Editor to create
program icons. The Hierarchy option will open a window and show you your
project's class hierarchy. Finally, from this menu, you can close all of the windows
that are currently open in the IDE. The ToolBar buttons (see Figure 13 below)
provide single­click access to the most common menu items. Hovering your mouse
cursor over one of the buttons will display a ToolTip that will tell you what menu
action that particular button will perform.</p>

<p>Figure 13 below shows you the File menu and ToolBar. From the Project
Explorer TreeView you can double­click on a form and it will pop up for you to
edit. Editing forms is simply a matter of selecting what type of control you'd like
to place on the form and then using the mouse to resize (draw) it on your form.

<p>Right clicking on the form or any of its children (controls) will show you a
pop­up menu that will allow you to perform operations on the control, edit its
properties or delete it. The currently selected control is indicated by four black
squares called handles. Clicking on a handle and using the mouse to drag the
control where you want it will allow you to move or resize the control. Double­
clicking on a control will bring up the code editor window and display any
existing event handler for the control or display a default event handler if there
have been none specified.</p>

<p>The Gambas Code Editor enables you to write code to handle events for the
controls you've placed on your form. In the ToolBox window, the Selection Tool
is the only item in the ToolBox that isn't actually a control. The Selection Tool
simply gives you control of the default mouse pointer. You use this pointer to
select controls and perform positioning and resizing operations on forms and their
associated controls.</p>

project. When we reopen it, all your work will be saved. In the next section, we
