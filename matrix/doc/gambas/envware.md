# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas

<br/>

Another feature of Gambas that sets it apart from other programming
languages is the capability of any window or dialog box to be used like a control.
This feature is not directly supported in other programming languages. Also,
Gambas projects are easily translatable, into almost any other language. We will
demonstrate this feature later in the book when we cover Internationalization
(i18n).

The Gambas Programming Environment
For now, let's take a quick tour of Gambas and introduce you to the
Gambas programming environment. All of the examples and code written for this
book were developed using Gambas version 1.0.9 running on Linspire ® 5.0 9 .
They should work on any platform that you can install Gambas on successfully.
For Linspire ® users, it is as simple as the click of a button using the Click­N­Run ®
warehouse feature of that product. When you first click the desktop icon to start
the Gambas program, you will be presented with an opening screen similar to that
found in Figure 2 above. The welcome screen allows you to create a new project,
open an existing project, view and select from recent projects, look at examples,
or quit. For our quick tour of Gambas, we are going to select the New Project
option and create our first Gambas project. You will see a dialog similar to Figure
3 below appear.
