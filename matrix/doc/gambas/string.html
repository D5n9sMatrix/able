<p>String constants can also contain the following escape characters:

<p>n CHR$(13)                                                                    <br/>

” Double quote                                                            <br/>
\ Backslash                                                                     <br/>
xx CHR$(&amp;Hxx)                                                             <br/></p>

<p>You can write a string constant in several successive parts. For example,
"My son" " is " "sixteen" is seen by Gambas as "My son is sixteen".
Variable Assignment
A programmer can assign any value to a variable in Gambas by using the
following general format:
Variable = Expression
This assignment statement assigns the value of an expression to one of the
following elements:
<br/></p>
<p>✔ A local variable                                                                 <br/>
✔ A function parameter                                                   <br/>
✔ A global (class) variable                                               <br/>
✔ An array element                                                              <br/>
✔ A public object variable or property                     <br/></p>
<p><br/>
Here are some example of variable assignments:
iMyVal = 1984
stMyName = "Orwell"
fMyNum = 123.45
Assignment Using The WITH Statement
This statement is most commonly used to set properties for controls. The
expression that exists between the WITH keyword and the END WITH instruction</p>
