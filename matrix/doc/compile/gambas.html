Gambas, a project contains class files, forms, modules, and data files. A Gambas
project is stored in a single directory. Compiling a project uses in incremental
compile method that only requires recompilation of the modified classes. Every
external reference of a class is solved dynamically at runtime. The Gambas
archiver transforms the entire project directory structure into a standalone
executable. The Gambas development environment was written with Gambas to
demonstrate the fantastic capabilities of the language.
Figure 1­ General overview of Gambas architecture.
Some other features that set Gambas apart from other languages include
the fact that Gambas has an extensible component architecture that allows
programmers to extend the language. Anyone can write components as shared
libraries that dynamically add new native classes to the interpreter. The
component architecture is documented online in the Gambas Wiki encyclopedia 5 .
