<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>First of all, a very special thanks to Benoît Minisini for the creation of Gambas
and for his support of this effort to further document this wonderful language. Without
Benoît's initiative, we would all be struggling to find a better tool than what exists today
on Linux platforms. Much of the initial documentation of the Gambas language was put
on the Gambas Wiki by Benoît and he deserves special credit for making this information
available. As it was the only known published source of definitive documentation in
existence prior to this writing, much of the reference material herein was gleaned from
that initial set of documentation. As with any written material, there is no guarantee
that this documentation is as accurate as what you may find in the latest release of the
Gambas product.
The author would like to extend a special thanks to Fabien Bodard for his help in
making this work become a reality. Fabien tirelessly edited code, reviewed the sample
projects presented herein, and provided great insight into the inner workings of Gambas
– all at the time of harvest for his vineyard. Laurent Carlier and Steve Starr both also
deserve my gratitude for their meticulous work editing the code and ensuring everything
worked as advertised. Their feedback, suggestions and corrections were greatly
appreciated. I would also like to thank Daniel Campos Fernández who was a great
asset in helping me to understand some of the finer points of Gambas. Nigel Gerrard
also contributed to the success of this project by providing a final review and edit of the
database material. From among these Gambas Hall of Fame coders, who else could have
done it better?
Countless emails were received from many members of the Gambas community,
all of which provided ongoing encouragement and support which motivated me to
complete this effort and make it available to everyone. Given the difficulties of writing a
book in the first place, it was a great feeling of satisfaction to receive such support from
complete strangers who all share the single vision of making Gambas a success. I can
only hope that this book will do justice to that effort and welcome any suggestions for
change, as well as any compliments or constructive criticism. It has been a lot of fun to
learn this wonderful new language and to explore the possibilities it offers. I dedicate
this book to all of those Gambas users and developers who have relied on each other in
the Gambas user/developer community to make this product become reality. Shared
vision, common goals, and open software are powerful forces that should not ever be
underestimated. Such forces have been known to change the world and will continue to
do so long after this book has been read and forgotten.
