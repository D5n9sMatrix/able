# A Beginner's Guide to Gambas
## Foreword

For the last three years, I have plunged headfirst into the Linux
programming environment. Considering my first installation of Linux was back in
1996, it should not be considered a good first start. As an enthusiastic Basic
developer, the Linux environment lacked a tool that would allow me to easily
program in the Linux environment. By chance, I stumbled upon a small project,
the fruit of more than two years of work from a man named Benoit Minisini. After
figuring out how to get past the idiosyncrasies of compilation, I discovered what
was to be the embryonic stages of one of the most fabulous projects i could have
imagined, Gambas! At that time, Gambas was already implemented with it's own
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a syntax highlighter. The ability
of Gambas to dynamically load components and remain fairly true to the Basic
language as used under Windows was an added benefit.
Today, Gambas has arrived as a mature product that, in it's first version,
allows a user to construct graphical applications or console based applications,
supports database management, connection to the Internet or to socket servers,
utilizes data compression, supports DCOP with KDE applications, and much more.
A Gambas application can be translated directly from the IDE and packaged in
binary form for different Linux distributions. What was initially alluring to me
still is ­­ Gambas has gone beyond being just another programming language
because it supports all of the features of a "professional" product while retaining
its simplicity. Gambas provides a real tool for the beginning programmer and
makes it possible for a novice programmer to develop high quality applications.
Here, in this book, you will find the first comprehensive treatment of Gambas. It
makes approaching the Gambas language simple and the reader can easily
progress from the beginner's level topics to the more advanced topics professional
programmers use daily.
Gambas has and will continue to evolve. Gambas Version 1.0 (discussed in
this book) is the foundation of a language which will evolve to be even more
powerful. For example, Gambas Version 2 will make it possible to make API calls
to a native library. It will allow programmers to manage even more types of
database servers and will work equally well with either Qt or GTK graphics
libraries. Gambas 2 will allow programmers to develop their own components
from within the Gambas environment. Developers will be able to create games
using SDL and OpenGL. The scope of the Gambas language is growing larger and
and the syntax is becoming more compact. All of these ideas for improvement

and change do not rest solely in the heads of a stable of chosen developers
working on the Gambas 2 project. They come from all Gambas users who provide
the ideas that make Gambas 2 even better than before. Already it can do so much
more than version 1.0. I strongly recommend that while you are waiting for the
stable release of Gambas 2, you begin your Gambas training with your machine
and what you will find in this book. It will prepare you for a wonderful
programming experience in the Linux environment.
